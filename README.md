# The-Hohmann-Transfer-Orbit-in-the-Four-Body-Problem
This project simulates a Hohmann Transfer Orbit within a simplified four-body system consisting of the Sun, Earth, Mars, and a rocket. Using Python and numerical integration, it models gravitational interactions and velocity maneuvers to transfer the rocket from Earthâ€™s orbit to Marsâ€™ orbit, extending the classical three-body problem framework.
This project models and simulates a Hohmann Transfer Orbit in a simplified four-body system consisting of the Sun, Earth, Mars, and a rocket launching from Earth. Starting from the classical three-body problem, we extend the system to include the rocketâ€™s launch and maneuver from Earthâ€™s orbit to Marsâ€™ orbit.

**Overview**
_Goal:_ Simulate a realistic transfer maneuver of a rocket launched from Earth to Mars and match Mars' orbital movement to be able to land on Mars.
_Method:_ Python simulation with numerical integration of gravitational interactions.
_Bodies_:
- Sun (central mass)
- Earth & Mars (planetary orbits)
- Rocket (transfer object)
_Approach:_
- Calculate orbital velocities
- Apply Hohmann Transfer equations
- Implement velocity changes (burns)
- Match phase angles for rendezvous with Mars

**Key Features**
- Numerical integration of gravitational interactions between multiple bodies
- Implementation of classical Hohmann transfer orbit equations
- 2D and 3D visualization of orbital trajectories with animation of the bodies
- Phase matching for a successful Mars rendezvous
- Extension from the three-body to the four-body problem dynamics

**Results**
- Successfully demonstrated a Hohmann Transfer Orbit from Earth to Mars.
- Provided a baseline framework for future orbital mechanics simulations with full mutual gravitational interactions.
