# The-Hohmann-Transfer-Orbit-in-the-Four-Body-Problem
This project simulates a Hohmann Transfer Orbit within a simplified four-body system consisting of the Sun, Earth, Mars, and a rocket. Using Python and numerical integration, it models gravitational interactions and velocity maneuvers to transfer the rocket from Earth’s orbit to Mars’ orbit, extendi
